					<p>About On 7 March 2019, the technology enabling skills to be uploaded into a person’s brain was patented
					(143 years to the day after the telephone was patented). This technology gives people immediate access to skills, that
					for whatever reason are unable to make this happen, through technical-osmosis.</p>
					<p>HOW?</p>
					<p>We implant a chip into your brain that allows neurons to develop synapses connections in that particular skill, thereby
					beginning to hardwire the brain to understand the activities associated about that skill. This then enables the brain
					to direct the body to physically perform the required dexterity required of those skills.</p>
					<p>Skillopia technology, unlike that of developing skills over time and/or through academic studies, gives the “Learnee”
					(a person who has employed Skillopia technology) instant access to the knowledge of recognised qualified individuals
					in that particular skill.</p>
					<p>Limited only by our ever growing database (and perhaps physical limitations), the Learnee is can learn anything
					from dancing, construction to landmine remover, pilot, even neurobiologist, just to name a few.</p>
					<p>WHY?</p>
					<p>Having these skills will allow you to:</P?
					<ul>
						<li>Build your own home (for example)</li>
						<li>Gain previously unattainable employment</li>
						<li>Self-development (although if removed your skills will no longer be recognised as per Skilloptia
						conditions and the associated organisations who also recognise this technology, you will retain some of the learnt information)</li>
						<li>Changing the world through research and development</li>
						<li>Achieve the marks at the educational institutions you have always wanted</li>
						<li>Become a better parent</li>
						<li>The list is endless</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Skillopia will give you the physical and educational skills to do what you want, however the innovation, imagination
					and creativity still belongs to you.</p>
